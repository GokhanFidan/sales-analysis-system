### üîÑ Using Different Datasets

This system is designed to work with any retail/e-commerce dataset. The system automatically detects column names using flexible patterns:

**Supported Column Patterns:**
- **Sales/Revenue**: 'sales', 'revenue', 'amount', 'total', 'value'
- **Profit**: 'profit', 'margin', 'income', 'earnings'
- **Customer ID**: 'customer_id', 'customer', 'cust_id', 'client_id'
- **Order Date**: 'date', 'order_date', 'purchase_date', 'transaction_date'
- **Category**: 'category', 'product_category', 'type'
- **Region**: 'region', 'location', 'area', 'zone'

**To use your own dataset:**
1. Place your CSV file in the `data/` directory
2. Update the file path in `config.py`:
   ```python
   DATA_FILE = DATA_DIR / 'your_dataset.csv'
   ```
3. Run the analysis - the system will automatically detect column patterns

**Minimum Required Columns:**
- Sales/Revenue column
- Date column  
- Customer identifier

The system will gracefully handle missing optional columns and provide warnings about unavailable analyses.

### Alternative Execution
```bash
# For custom analysis workflows
python -c "
from sales_analyzer import SalesAnalyzer
from visualizer import SalesVisualizer

analyzer = SalesAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_and_validate_data()
analyzer.preprocess_data()
# Add custom analysis steps...
"
```
